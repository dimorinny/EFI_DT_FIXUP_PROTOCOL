Background
----------

Device-trees are used to convey information about hardware to the operating
system. Some of the properties are only known at boot time. (One example of such
a property is the number of the boot hart on RISC-V systems.) Therefore the
firmware applies fix-ups to the original device-tree. Some nodes and properties
are added or altered.

Typically the software support for hardware is introduced in small steps and not
in a big bang approach. The device-tree used to describe the hardware is
developed in parallel. Sometimes backward compatibility is broken. New versions
of operating systems cannot boot with old device-trees or old versions of
operating systems cannot boot with new device-trees.

This leads to operating systems providing version specific device-trees. It can
be desirable that a boot manager (e.g. GRUB) can provide the device-tree that
best matches the chosen operating system. But the device-tree provided by the
operating system will lack the fix-ups that the firmware would apply.

Objective
---------

The objective of this specification is to define a UEFI protocol implemented by
firmware that a boot manager can call to apply fix-ups to device-trees.

DEVICETREE_FIXUP_PROTOCOL
---------------------

This section provides a detailed description for the device-tree fix-up
protocol.

Summary
~~~~~~~

The device-tree fix-up protocol provides a function that allows the firmware to
modify a DT to ensure it aligns with the firmware's specific view of the
platform.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

Revision
    The version of the DEVICETREE_FIXUP_PROTOCOL. The version specified by this
    specification is 0x00010000. All future revisions must be backward
    compatible. If a new version of the specification breaks backward
    compatibility, a new GUID must be defined.

Fixup
    Applies fix-ups to a device-tree.

DEVICETREE_FIXUP_PROTOCOL.Fixup()

Summary
~~~~~~~

Applies fix-ups to a device-tree.

Prototype

.. code-block:: c

    typedef EFI_STATUS
    (EFIAPI *DEVICETREE_FIXUP) (
        IN DEVICETREE_FIXUP_PROTOCOL *This,
        IN VOID                      *Fdt,
        IN OUT UINTN                 *BufferSize
        );

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

This
    Pointer to the protocol

Fdt
    Buffer with the device-tree.

BufferSize
    Pointer to the size of the buffer including trailing unused bytes for
    fix-ups. If the buffer size is too small, the required buffer size is
    returned.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Fixup()** function is called by a UEFI binary that has loaded a
device-tree to let the firmware apply firmware specific fix-ups.

The extent to which the validity of the device-tree is checked is
implementation-dependent. But a buffer without the correct value of the *magic*
field of the flattened device-tree header must be rejected with
**EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER**.

The buffer size must at least equal the *totalsize* field of the device tree.

The required buffer size should enforce at least 4 KiB unused space for
additional fix-ups by the operating system or the caller. The available space in
the device-tree shall be determined using the device-tree header fields::

    available = header->totalsize
              - header->off_dt_strings
              - header->size_dt_strings

(The strings block is always last in the flattened device-tree. There might be
more space between blocks but not all device-tree libraries can use it.)

If the buffer is too small, **EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL** is returned, the
device-tree is unmodified and the value pointed to by *BufferSize* is updated
with the required buffer size for the provided device-tree.

If any other error code is returned the state of the device-tree is undefined.
The caller should discard the buffer content.
